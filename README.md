This repo includes base implementation of DV-Pari proof system over sect233k1.

Components:
- Module to read sparse R1CS representation generated by fork of succinctlabs/sp1 zkvm
- Polynomial operations with ECFFT using a fork of andrewmilson/ecfft library
- DV-Pari proof system sub components for setup, proving and verification stages

Includes tests using toy R1CS. 

Run the following command from inside `dv-pari` directory to observe setup, proving and verification steps.
```bash
cargo test --package dv-pari --lib -- dvsnark_test::tests::test_dvsnark_prover_over_toy_r1cs --exact --show-output
```

For cleaner tests that separate prover and verifier's tasks more cleanly, along with end-to-end tests for SP1 integration with DV-Pari, check `integration` repository.

For binary circuit implementation of this verifier, check [dv-pari-circuit](https://github.com/alpenlabs/dv-pari-circuit) repository.
